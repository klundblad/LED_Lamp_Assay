PWM stands for "Pulse Width Modulation", the 555 timer IC acts as a Comparator to output a desired current to the LED's. Its current configuration
assumes a potentiometer will be outside of the field box to control externally while data is captured. The battery may also be external in order 
to limit the amount of tampering with the inside of the field box
